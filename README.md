# Azure DevOps Python API

This repository contains Python APIs for interacting with and managing Azure DevOps. These APIs power the Visual Studio Team Services CLI. To learn more about the VSTS CLI, visit the [Microsoft/vsts-cli](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-cli) repo.

## Install 

```
pip install vsts
```

## Get started


To use the API, establish a connection using a [personal access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=vsts) and the URL to your Azure DevOps organization. Then get a client from the connection and make API calls.

```python
from vsts.vss_connection import VssConnection
from msrest.authentication import BasicAuthentication
import pprint

# Fill in with your personal access token and org URL
personal_access_token = 'YOURPAT'
organization_url = 'https://dev.azure.com/YOURORG'

# Create a connection to the org
credentials = BasicAuthentication('', personal_access_token)
connection = VssConnection(base_url=organization_url, creds=credentials)

# Get a client (the "core" client provides access to projects, teams, etc)
core_client = connection.get_client('vsts.core.v4_0.core_client.CoreClient')

# Get the list of projects in the org
projects = core_client.get_projects()

# Show details about each project in the console
for project in projects:
    pprint.pprint(project.__dict__)
```

## API documentation

This Python library provides a thin wrapper around the Azure DevOps REST APIs. See the [Azure DevOps REST API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/?view=vsts-rest-5.0) for details on calling different APIs.

## Samples

Learn how to call different APIs by viewing the samples in the [Microsoft/azure-devops-python-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-python-samples) repo.
